# Description
I implemented a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. I used Keras and Tensorflow to implement the genrator and discriminator networks.

# Results 
The results are pretty stunning! They will not fool a human but they do clearly have some resemblance to the dataset's handwritten digits. 
I only used networks with 2-3 hidden layers! A deper network should deliver more convinving results. Using two convolutional networks should also help too.

# Tensorflow and Virtual Enviroment Setup
It is easiest to run Tensorflow from a virtual enviroment on Linux. Here are instructions on how to setup Tensorflow and the virtual enviroment https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-ubuntu-18-04/

To activate the virtual enviroment: ```source venv/bin/activate```
