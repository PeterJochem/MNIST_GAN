# Description
I implemented a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. I used Keras and Tensorflow to implement the genrator and discriminator networks.

# Results 
The results are pretty stunning! I ran the algorithm on my laptop and got the following results in about 30 minutes. I only used networks with 2-3 hidden layers too! I am hoping to implement the same algorithm with two convolutional neural networks next.

# Tensorflow and Virtual Enviroment Setup
It is easiest to run Tensorflow from a virtual enviroment on Linux. Here are instructions on how to setup Tensorflow and the virtual enviroment https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-ubuntu-18-04/

To activate the virtual enviroment: ```source venv/bin/activate```
